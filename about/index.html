It is also a huge privilege to get to know, and work with, patients and their families/carers in their own environment towards what is most important to them at that time.</p><p>I qualified with a 1st Class degree in physiotherapy in 2004, having initially studied Geography at Durham University (1998-2001 BSc 1st Class Hons), and have over 15 years experience specialising in the field of neuro rehabilitation.</p><p>Early on in my career I gained invaluable experience working at St George’s Hospital in London and within the local Primary Care Trust, which included time working at The Wolfson Neurorehabilitation Centre and for the neuro inpatient team at Queen Mary’s Roehampton.</p><p>I currently work part time in the community neurological rehab team within Sussex Community Foundation Trust, and two days with private clients. My NHS work enables valuable links and communication, when appropriate, with our specialist nurses, allied health care professionals and rehabilitation consultants, to ensure holistic care for patients.</p><p>Work life is juggled around our three lively daughters and Bramble, our dog, who certainly all keep us on our toes! As a family we enjoy the outdoors, running, camping and walking together.</p><p>Please do get in touch if you would like to discuss how neurological physiotherapy could be tailored to you, or to the needs of someone you care for.</p></div></div></div></div></div><section class="bar background-pentagon no-mb"><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-md-12><div class="heading text-center"><h2>Patient Stories</h2></div><p class=lead></p><ul class="owl-carousel testimonials same-height-row" data-items=4 data-autoplay=false data-slide-speed=2000 data-pagination-speed=1000><li class=item><div class="testimonial same-height-always"><div class=text><p><p>&ldquo;I have been receiving physiotherapy with Rachael for approximately 9 months.

She is knowledgeable about my condition (MS) and tailors the exercises to my limitations, whilst encouraging me to push myself as and when I can. In addition to her skills as a physiotherapist, Rachael is always warm and friendly, making our sessions relaxed and fun.

This is further supported through the communication and liaison she has with a specialist PD nurse.
